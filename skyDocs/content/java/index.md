# The LogicMonitor Java Data library

This Java Library is suitable for ingesting the metrics or logs into the LogicMonitor Platform.

## Overview

LogicMonitor's Push Metrics feature allows you to send metrics directly
to the LogicMonitor platform via a dedicated API, removing the need to
route the data through a LogicMonitor Collector. Once ingested, these
metrics are presented alongside all other metrics gathered via
LogicMonitor, providing a single pane of glass for metric monitoring and
alerting.

Similarly, If a log integration isnâ€™t available or you have custom logs that you want to analyze,
you can send the logs directly to your LogicMonitor account via the logs ingestion API.

## Quick Start Notes:

### Use [GitHub Package](https://github.com/orgs/logicmonitor/packages?repo_name=lm-data-sdk-java)

Add the package dependencies to your build.gradle or pom.xml

#### Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation('com.logicmonitor:lm-data-sdk:0.0.1-alpha')
}
```

#### Maven

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.logicmonitor</groupId>
  <artifactId>lm-data-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-alpha</version>
</dependency>
```

LM_ACCESS_KEY properties, In Case of BearerToken Authentication set LM_BEARER_TOKEN property. Company's name or Account
